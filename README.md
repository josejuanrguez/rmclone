# rmclone
rmclone is an alternative to the rm command which moves files to a trash bin in compressed format to reduce the space used on disk and allowing you to recover them later.

Take into account that this code is still under development, is being heavily tested and may contains bugs. Don't use it in production environments. Thanks.
